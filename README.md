-------------------------------------------------------------

Overview

The platform provides a unified environment for managing investment opportunities instead of relying on scattered files or disconnected data sources that are difficult to search, connect, and analyze.

Each investment opportunity is represented as an integrated record that can be connected to:

- Sector and activity
- Geographic location
- Financial information
- Project information
- Employment data
- Infrastructure
- Site characteristics
- Approvals and readiness
- Related entities
- Investors
- Contracts
- Attachments
- Analytical results

The data is stored in a relational PostgreSQL database and exposed through REST APIs. The frontend consumes these services and presents the information through an Arabic RTL web interface designed for both desktop and mobile screens.

In addition to data presentation, the platform provides a preliminary analytical layer based on weighted indicators to support structured investment assessment.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Objectives

The platform focuses on the following objectives:

1. Organize investment opportunity data in a structured relational database.
2. Standardize the information associated with each opportunity.
3. Connect investment opportunities with their geographic locations.
4. Provide fast search and filtering capabilities.
5. Provide dashboards for aggregated investment indicators.
6. Enable analysis by sectors, locations, statuses, and readiness.
7. Present financial, operational, geographic, and infrastructure information.
8. Provide investment readiness indicators.
9. Apply a transparent weighted-indicator model for preliminary investment assessment.
10. Provide automated opportunity analysis through backend API services.
11. Establish a scalable technical architecture for future integrations and data expansion.

System Layers

Data Layer

PostgreSQL is used as the primary relational database for storing investment opportunities and their related information.

Service Layer

FastAPI provides backend services and handles communication between the frontend and the database.

Analysis Layer

The analysis component currently uses predefined indicators, rules, and weights to generate preliminary investment assessment results.

Presentation Layer

React and TypeScript are used to build the frontend interface, dashboards, opportunity pages, analytical views, and other components.

Geographic Layer

Leaflet is used to display investment opportunities geographically and connect location data with opportunity records.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Database

The platform uses PostgreSQL as its primary database management system.

Key database tables and components include:

text
investment_opportunities
sectors
sub_sectors
locations
project_details
financial_data
employment
entities
opportunity_approvals
opportunity_infrastructure
opportunity_site_features
opportunity_attachments
investors
contracts


This structure separates different categories of information while maintaining relationships between them.

The relational design also makes it easier to extend the platform with additional data categories and services.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Backend and API

The backend is developed using Python and FastAPI.

The backend is responsible for:

- Connecting to PostgreSQL
- Retrieving investment opportunities
- Retrieving detailed opportunity information
- Providing analytical services
- Returning structured JSON responses
- Providing OpenAPI documentation
- Processing frontend requests

Main API Endpoints

text
GET  /api/health
GET  /api/opportunities
GET  /api/opportunities/{code}
GET  /api/ai/opportunity/{opportunity_code}
POST /api/ai/opportunities/{opportunity_id}/analyze


Additional database and service endpoints are available within the deployed API.

API Documentation

The platform provides an interactive Swagger/OpenAPI interface where API endpoints can be inspected and tested.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Frontend

The frontend is developed using:

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS

The interface is designed primarily for Arabic RTL usage and is responsive across desktop and mobile screens.

Main Pages and Modules

The current platform includes interfaces for:

- Dashboard
- Investment Opportunities
- Opportunity Details
- Interactive Map
- Sectors
- Locations
- Investors
- Financial Data
- Contracts
- Attachments
- Entities
- Ready Opportunities
- New Opportunities
- Investment Analysis
- Reports
- Data Tables

The frontend communicates with the backend through the deployed REST API rather than connecting directly to PostgreSQL.

-------------------------------------------------------------

GIS and Interactive Map

The platform uses Leaflet to display investment opportunities geographically.

Each opportunity can contain geographic coordinates that allow its location to be displayed on the interactive map.

The map supports:

- Displaying opportunity locations
- Exploring geographic distribution
- Viewing summary information
- Navigating to opportunity details
- Supporting spatial analysis of investment opportunities

The geographic component can be expanded in future versions through additional GIS layers and more advanced spatial analysis.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Investment Analysis Model

The platform currently uses a Rule-Based / Weighted Indicators model for preliminary investment assessment.

The model is designed to provide a transparent and interpretable assessment based on predefined indicators and weights.

Current Weights

| Indicator      |   Weight |
| -------------- | -------: |
| Market         |      20% |
| Financial      |      20% |
| Location       |      15% |
| Infrastructure |      15% |
| Readiness      |      15% |
| Employment     |      10% |
| Risk           |       5% |
| Total      | 100% |

The indicators are combined according to their predefined weights to produce an overall investment attractiveness score and analytical interpretation.

Current Nature of the Analysis

The current system is not a machine-learning model trained on historical investment data.

Instead, it uses predefined rules, indicators, and weights.

This approach makes the current assessment model transparent, explainable, and easier to review or modify.

Future versions may incorporate Machine Learning or predictive models once sufficient reliable historical investment data becomes available.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Dashboard and Indicators

The dashboard indicators are connected to the actual PostgreSQL data through the backend API.

The main indicators include:

- Total number of opportunities
- Active opportunities
- Ready opportunities
- Total investment value
- Number of sectors
- Number of regions
- Sector distribution
- Geographic distribution
- Opportunity status distribution

The core dashboard indicators are not based on static values embedded in the frontend.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Current Data

The current database contains investment opportunity records and supporting data distributed across the main database tables.

Current verified record counts include:

text
investment_opportunities      : 36
sectors                       : 10
sub_sectors                   : 29
locations                     : 35
project_details               : 35
financial_data                : 36
employment                    : 35
entities                      : 9
opportunity_approvals         : 35
opportunity_infrastructure    : 35
opportunity_site_features     : 35
opportunity_attachments       : 9


The number of records differs between tables because some related information is optional or is not currently available for every investment opportunity.

-------------------------------------------------------------
